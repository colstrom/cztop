cztop
=====

This is a CZMQ Ruby binding, based on the official, automatically generated,
low-level FFI bindings for CZMQ.

I haven't been able to come up with a better name.

Reasons
-------

* https://github.com/zeromq/czmq low-level FFI bindings for CZMQ, not a gem
* https://github.com/Asmod4n/ruby-ffi-czmq outdated, "abomination" (according to author @Asmod4n)
* https://github.com/methodmissing/rbczmq is a Ruby extension (bad JRuby support)
* https://github.com/chuckremes/ffi-rzmq is for libzmq (low level)
* https://github.com/mtortonesi/ruby-czmq (czmq gem), no tests, outdated
